**Node Modules**
 * Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicate with an external application on the basis of their related functionality. 
 * Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiple files/folders. 
 * The reason programmers are heavily depended on modules is because of their reusability as well as the ability to break down a complex piece of code into manageable chunks. 

 **There are differenet types of modules**
* Core Modules
* Local Modules
* Third-party modules

1. Core Modules: Node.js has many built-in modules that are part of the platform and come with Node.js installation.

* http: creates an HTTP server in Node.js.
* fs: used to handle file system.
* path: includes methods to deal with file paths.
* process: provides information and control about the current Node.js process.
* os: provides information about the operating system.
* querystring: utility used for parsing and formatting URL query strings.
* url: module provides utilities for URL resolution and parsing.

2. Local Modules: Unlike built-in and external modules, local modules are created locally in your Node.js application.

3. Third Party:Third-party modules are modules that are available online using the Node Package Manager(NPM).

**Example**:
* npm install express
* npm install mongoose
* npm install -g @angular/cli
